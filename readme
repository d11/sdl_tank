PROJECT: TANK

This is a simplish SDL shooter. Called tank for no reason, so far. There are no tanks. So far, it just serves as a test bed for some of my graphics and AI ideas.

Control system is yet to be decided - current method is WASD, player turns to face the cursor position (like FPS but top-down).
This will probably change since it is not very intuitive.

TODO
- Perhaps it would be good to merge this with the flash tank system
- Tidy up a lot! Mostly make things use smaller functions
- Work out how to move graphics code into a separate library
- Move graphics code into a separate library!
- Levels, loading?
- Different weapons
- I don't know what else... whatever seems like a good idea at the time.
